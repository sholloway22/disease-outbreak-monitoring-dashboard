This Excel project models a real-world disease outbreak monitoring system.
It demonstrates how analysts can integrate multiple healthcare datasets, perform data transformation, and design an interactive dashboard — all within Excel.

Project Overview
The workbook includes four core sheets that work together:
Cases – Records daily confirmed, recovered, and quarantined cases across regions with demographics and testing rates.
Capacity – Tracks hospital resources: bed counts, ICU availability, staff, and equipment.
Interventions – Encodes qualitative public health measures (lockdowns, tracing, vaccination rates) into numeric form for analysis.
Dashboard – Displays KPIs, charts, and filters for real-time outbreak monitoring.

Key Features
Multi-sheet integration to simulate real healthcare data systems
Dynamic KPIs: Confirmed, Recovered, Quarantined, and Recovery Rate
Interactive slicers and timelines for flexible filtering by region, age group, and case type
GETPIVOTDATA automation for responsive KPI calculations
Encoded categorical data (e.g., Yes/No, High/Low) for improved analytical modeling
Clean dashboard visualization with color-coded health indicators
Dummy dataset designed for scalability and EHR migration use cases

Skills Demonstrated
Excel | Data Cleaning | PivotTables | GETPIVOTDATA | IF Functions | Dashboard Design | Healthcare Analytics | Data Encoding

Why It Matters
This project simulates the core logic behind public health surveillance dashboards.
It shows how Excel can evolve from a basic spreadsheet into a functional data intelligence tool capable of handling multi-source healthcare data — ideal for data analysts, HIM professionals, and health operations teams.
